# World of Valheim - Server Side Config

Note: This mod is a [BepInEx Plugin](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/denikson/BepInExPack_Valheim/)﻿ and thus requires this in order to be used.

This is a fork of the [Valheim Online Plugin﻿](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/477) by AluvielDev.

**We have been given permissions by AluvielDev for the release of his modified assets. He also changed the plugin permission on the Valheim-Online page with the following "You are allowed to modify my files and release bug fixes or improve on the features so long as you credit me as the original creator.".

This mod takes two of the features of Valheim-Online (PVP FORCED ON & SAFE-ZONES) and builds on it.  Adding an entire Zones config file and giving the option to enable/disable pvp & shared positioning or even just allowing the client to take over in certain "Zones"
